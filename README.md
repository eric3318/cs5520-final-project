**Contributions**<br>
Zhiyu:<br>
Zhiyu implemented the code for "TrainerMap" screen (accessed via "Locate Nearby Trainers" in Appointment screen) . For TrainerMap screen, Zhiyu added markers for user location, and added markers for all trainers. The markers' size would dynamically adjust based on the zoom level. Also, the trainers would be clustered when the map is in a high zoom level. When user clicks on the markers (avatars) of the trainers, there would be a modal showing information of the trainer and button to make an appointment with the trainer. If the user clicks "Reserve", he/she would enter the same reserve screen they would enter if they clicks "Reserve" in appointment screen.<br>
